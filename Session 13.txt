Non-parametric tests are applied when there are mismatches in the variablity of the data.
There are quite a variety of methods available. Other than the Wilcox-Man-Whitney test, there is also the Kruskal-Wallis test.
But, Kruskal-Wallis will not really be part of the exam. Just perhaps remember that the test exists if you have three or more samples.

#Wilcox-Man-Whitney U Test

d1 <- c(100,99,84,81,80,75,74,70,62,60)
d2 <- c(82,79,76,69,67,64,59,58,57,56)

wilcox.test(d1,d2)
