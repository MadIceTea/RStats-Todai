#What is a contingency table like this one show us?
#It shows us the relation between two variables; here, "an exposure to the model" and "a control with no model"

#Come up with a statement to describe the situation of the contingency in the table.
#Those exposed to the model will be more likely to give the candy than those not exposed.

#How do we detect the association of being exposed to the model and not? How can we compare if they are related or not?
#Well, that is what a contingency table is asking us. Further, we may use a special kind of nonparametric regression, called the x-squared value.
#But, we should be careful. The real chi-squared distribution is more complicated - the summation of i=1 to k of a function value z-sub-i squared.

#Degrees of Freedom in a Contingency Table - How to calculate?
#df=(r-1)(c-1) | [r=#rows and c=#cols]

x <- matrix(c(25,15,10,30), ncol=2, nrow=2, byrow=T)
chisq.test(x, correct=F)

#We should note a high chance of a Type I error from a small sample size.

#When should we call the sample "small"?
#In total, when N<=40 it is "small"
#Any cells should be larger that 5, else it is "small"
#The above two were made by a guy named Cochran. So, it is called Cochran's Rule.
#Any cells should be larger than 10 for the "Goodness" of Fit Test", else it is "small".

#What is the Fisher's Test
#It allows us to look at the contingency table values individually and do a probabilistic analysis involving factorials.

#What is the correction for continuity?
#It is used as a correction, but only if the contingency table represents a "small" sample.
