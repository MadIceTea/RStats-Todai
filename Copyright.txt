Currently, this code is provided on GitHub public repository, meaning I have given up the right to only allow me to pull the code.

THAT SAID, I HAVE NOT GIVEN UP COMMERCIAL, RE-USE, DISTRIBUTION, PATENT, or any other rights by doing this. These lie with:

(c) 2016, Prof. Masakazu Shimada / Alexander Zen Taniguchi-Wiegman @ The University of Tokyo

The copyrights lie fully and rest with these two. Attempt should be made to contact them both in any want of re-use of the code, where the GitHub Disclaimer.txt file in this commit should provide the official contact information.

The files have the right to be changed at any time by the original uploader.

As for any secondary pulls and the like, as the GitHub Disclaimer file states, there should be a request by email, if nothing else, out of courtesy. If not, GitHub will notify me, and I will take action.

Any wants to use for commercial software, or for monetary gain shall be routed through us both.

Any wants for use in patent technology, outside of the University of Tokyo, shall officially have final decisions rest with me (Alex).

The World Copyright Act by the UN Copryight Convention states I do not need to pay a patent or copyright office a country to retain rights to my work. These are rights naturally guaranteed to me, esp. all the more if I declare them explicitly. Any rights not stated here shall refer to the general rights of ownership. THIS INCLUDES COMMENT ON THE CODE.

Any other rights not here lie with the uploader by default.

Again, this document may change at any time. It may even disappear.
(GitHub may even disappear!)
